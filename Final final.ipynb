Therefore, the system can count but has to be modulo $10^{\\text{number of rotors}}$. An example to do with computers would be,\n",

Additionally, if the input to a function is set as 'int64' then the function is limited to working with 64 bit integers. Therefore, for the numba algorithms they can only be used with bits smaller than the bit size of the CPU. Also when there is a square in the algorithm the input has to be a bit number half the bit size of the CPU.\n",

The Caesar Cipher does this by first choosing a key which can be a number from 1 to 26 (this can be a larger range as you add more characters as you'll see) let's say we choose the key 12. Now you align the number 12, which has the letter L associated with it, with the letter A and shift everything else along with it as shown below.\n",

    "\n",
    "Although The Caesar Cipher would of been useful before the age of computers, today it is very rare in usage other than for introductions to Ciphers. The reason for this is because it is simply too easy for a computer to \"Brute-force attack\" the cipher. A Bruter-force attack is simple, it is an algorithm which attempts every possible key for a message and outputs the decryption of that message. In more advandced ciphers this is not a feasible method for cracking an encrypted message. However since the Caesar Cipher has a very small amount of possible keys, in our case only 95, it takes very little time to attempt every key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now reading through every decrypted message to check if it is the original may still take a while, so we can check some properties the original message might display. For example if we know the most commonly used letter in the english language and the most commonly used word, we could quickly check if the decrypted message contains this word or has the same most common letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency, which we will use again later, we see that \"e\" is the most common letter, making up about 12.702% of all used letters. Also using data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English, we see that \"the\" is the most common word in the english language. From this we can check if the most common letter in our decrypted message is \"e\", or if the word \"the\" is contained within our decrypted message. If it is then we could highlight this message, which will allow us to see messages which our more likely to be the true message, and save us time. This is a technique we will go more in depth with later, this is just basic implementation of this data.\n"

    "### The Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will look at another substitution cipher called the Vigenère Cipher. In fact the Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher, which means it uses multiple keys to encrypt the data at different points of the data. The Vigenère Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is just the Caesar Cipher applied to data multiple times with different keys at each point cycling through the same subkeys given by the key of the Vigenère Cipher. To clear this up it is easy to first follow an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a message we wish to encrypt using the Vigenère Cipher, we will use the message \"ENCRYPT THIS MESSAGE\". Now we need a key which we will use to encrypt this message, however unlike the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenère Cipher uses a collection of letters (or later we will see any character) to encrypt the message. For our example we will use the key \"SECRET\". Now each letter of our key \"SECRET\" is a subkey and we will cycle through these keys and apply the Caeser Cipher at each point in our message using the current subkey. Hence the first letter in our message is \"E\", and the first letter in our key is \"S\", so the letter \"E\" will be encrypted using the Caeser Cipher and the key \"S\". However of course \"S\" is not a number as our keys were when we previously used the Caesar Cipher, however again if you look at the table we used when discussing the Caesar Cipher, you can see the letter S has the number 19 associated with it, so this is the key we use. Thus the subkey used at each letter of the message is show below.     \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "    Vigenère key  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  | S  |    | E  | C  | R  | E  |    | T  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  |\n",
    "    Caesar subkey | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 | 19 |    | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  |    | 20 | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|       \n",
    "    Message       | E  | N  | C  | R  | Y  | P  | T  |    | T  | H  | I  | S  |    | M  | E  | S  | S  | A  | G  | E  |\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "However again as happened with the Caesar Cipher we can see that spaces must be ignored for now and all other characters but capital letters, again two versions of the Vigenère Cipher will be given, one basic and one which can use as many characters as you want (In ASCII). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Although the Vigenère Cipher is similar to the Caeser Cipher, it is orders of magnitude more secure. For example with the character set above \"Alphabet\", the Caesar Cipher has only 26 keys to attempt, however the Vigenère Cipher has $26^{n}$ possible keys where $n$ is the length of the key. Thus the longer the key you use the more secure your encrypted message is, this is why we can not use the \"Brute-force Attack\" against a message encrypted with Vigenère Cipher (Technically we can however this will become very unfeisable as the length of the key increases)."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher Using The Dictionary\n",
    "Here we will begin looking at how to crack the Vigenère Cipher, as mentioned before this is more difficult to do than on a message encrypted using the Caeser Cipher as we can not simple brute-force attack the message. The problem is that if the person encrypting the message is using only the alphabet as their character set to encrypt their message, we do not know how long the key is they are using. If we were to assume the key was of length somewhere in the range [1,12] we have many keys to test, in fact we have.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} 26^{i} = 99246114928149461$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a lot more than the 26 we had for the Caesar Cipher. On top of this taking the computer a very long time, we still have no rubust criteria that we can check a decrypted message against to see if it could be the original message, and it would take an extremly long time to check all 99246114928149462 decrypted messages. To add to the seemingly impossible task of cracking this cipher, we do not know how long the key actually is, so for all we know the key may be of length 10, 100, 1000 or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus when trying to crack the Vigenère Cipher, we must go about this using a more efficent and robust method. One method we will use is called a \"Dictionary attack\", many hackers will use this method to attempt many passwords to gain access to someones account. This method depends on one key idea, that humans tend to use words for passwords or in this case for the key because words are easier to remember, however because of these dictionary attacks, this can leave your account or encryption vulnerable. The basis of these dictionary attacks is to simply attempt a very large set of words as the key to try and decrypt a message. This is very simple, as to do this we can download a text file filled with english words (The text file I will be using can be found here http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). Now all we have to do is attempt every word on this file, which on the file we will be using is 65,000 words. Though this may seem like many words you must keep in mind that even if we knew that the key was of length 4, using a brute-force attack we would still need to attempt,\n",
    "\n",
    ">$26^{4} = 4569764$ keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as I mentioned, there is one more problem we must over come, we can not manually check all 65,000 decrypted messages ourself as this will take a long time. To get around this we come up with a more robust method for checking if a message is likely the original than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a function which splits up each word (collectios of characters with a space inbetween them) in the decrypted message for a given key, and puts each individual word into a potential word list. Then for each element in the list, we want to check if this element is the same as any word in our dictionary text file which indicates that this element is a word. Thus we count how many words this message contains and then divide this by how many elements are in the potential word list, to get the percentage of words in this decrypted message are in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need a function that checks if the percentage of real words (words in the dictionary) and percentage of letters to characters in a message is above a certain threshold. If the message is above our threshold percentage, than we say there is a chance this is the original message. Hence by combining these two functions we have a more robust procedure to make sure only decrypted messages which are very likely to be the original are shown, which in effect means we only have to read a handful of wrong messages."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher (Key Lengths)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now clearly the method used above is not very efficent and has many limitations as checking 65,000 keys can still take a long time for the average computer, especially when the key used for encyption may not even be a word so will not be able to be decrypted using this method. Another problem is that if the word starts with a z for example \"zurrich\", the algorithm will try every word that comes before it alphabetically, rather than trying the most likely keys first. We now try to get past these limitations and crack the Vigenère Cipher for almost all cases as we will see, in doing this we will no longer use the basic Vigenère Cipher, instead we will use the extended version that uses any character set. The method we will be using is called \"The Babbage Attack & Kasiski Examination\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this method is to identify any repeated sequences in the enrypted message. We only count sequences of letters of 3 or more, however in this code we will limit ourselves to sequences of any length from 3 to 6 to speed up the algorithm. The reason we do this is because many words such as \"the\", as I mentioned before, are used many times in a single message, or we can notice that most verbs have the same ending \"ing\". Now if we notice that the same sequence of letters repeat multiple times, this may indicate the same letters being encrypted using the same subkey as before due to the subkey repeating. For example, if we encrypt the sentance \"You going running?\", using our Vigenère Cipher with the key \"examples\", the output is \"?hWmX\\\\ObMxTc_[ObM8\". We notice that the sequence of letters \"obM\" repeats twice. This can be explained by following the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vigenère key  | e  | x  | a  |  m | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  | a  | m  | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|     \n",
    "    Message       | Y  | o  | u  |    | g  | o  | i  | n  | g  |    | r  | u  | n  | n  | i  | n  | g  | ?  | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how in our message we have the repeated sequence \"ing\" eppear twice, and both times this is being encrypted using the \n",
    "same subkeys, \"e\", \"s\" and \"e\" respectively. This is extremely useful when trying to find the key, as we can now count the number of characters between repeats of sequences. As you can see the number of characters between the repeated sequence \"obM\" in our encrypted message is 8, counting from the first letter of the first sequence, to the letter before the beggining of the second sequence. Here it just so happens that the number of characters between the repeats is the exact same as the legnth of the key, however this will not happen all the time. Though this is not always true it is true that if the same letters in the orginial message are being encoded by the same characters in the key, than one of the factors of the distance between these two sequences must be the true key length, due to the cyclic nature of the encryption. This brings us to the next step of our method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must find the factors of the distance between repeated sequences. To show how we do this we will look at a longer encrypted message given below:\n",

    "\n",
    "Now you can check for youself using the functions below, this encrypted message has four repeated sequences \"K\\\\X\", \"\\\\XL\", \"A7W\" and \"K\\\\XL\". Now the distances between these repeated sequences are 8, 48, 72 and 80. In this part of the method as I mentioned we get the factors of the distances between the sequences, however we only want the factors that occur most, as these are more likely to be the true key length. In this case the most likely key lengths would be 2, 4 and 8 as they are factors of all 4 distances. Our next step will be to get every second, fourth and eigth letter, however before doing this we will create functions to carry out our method thus far.\n",

With the functions we created above, our next step is to now get every $N^{th}$ letter from the encrypted message where $N$ is our most likely key lengths. We will have to do this for all key lengths we think could potentially be correct, which we set to be limited to the 5 most likely above. This is very simple for us to do, we just look at our message and choose every $N^{th}$ character starting from the first character of the message. We then do this again starting from the second character of the message, and repeat this up to the $N-1$ character in the message. Again we repeat this for each potential key length. For example for the encrypted message we used before:\n",

This is important to us as now we can attempt every possible character for each character in the key which is only $95n$ subkeys to attempt for a key of length $n$. Our next step will be deciding which characters are most likely to be our subkey.\n",

From this we want to analyse the frequency of letters that occur in each decrypted message and see how well this message matches the data above. We do this by checking if the 6 most frequent letters in our decrypted message and the 6 least frequent letters match the data . From the data we see the 6 most frequent letters are \"ETAOIN\" and the 6 least frequent are \"VKJXQZ\". Thus we score each decrypted message on how many of their 6 most frequent and least frequent letters match the true 6 most frequent and least frequent. The subkeys that cause the decrypted message to have the highest score are than the most likely subkey used on these letters, which means we have found candiates for what is most likely the $n^{th}$ letter in the true key where $n$ is what character we start from when choosing every $N^{th}$ letter. \n",

However I feel it is noteworth to mention the fact that if the encrypter uses a key the same length of the message, the message is uncrackable without attempting every possible key length and combination.

    "Now we will look at our third and final cipher, the Affine Cipher. Again the Affine Cipher is another monoalphabetic substitution cipher, in fact the Affine Cipher incorporates two ciphers in one. The first cipher it uses we have already met, it is the Caesar Cipher however the other cipher we have yet to discuss, it is called the Multiplicative Cipher. Before we discuss the Affine Cipher, we must understand the Multiplicative Cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multiplicative Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is the same sort of substituion cipher as the Caesar Cipher. The only difference between the two is that in the Caesar Cipher we find the index of each character in a message and add the value of our key to the characters index to get a new index which we use to substitute our original character out for a new one, however in the Multplicative Cipher, rather than simply adding the key to the index we multiply it. Again like in the Caesar Cipher, this multiplying of the index must be done modulo the length of our character set as if we did not do this our new index may be out of the character sets range. Below we will look at the same example we used for the Caesar Cipher, and see how a key of 12 will affect the indexes if we were to use the alphabet as our character set for the Multiplicative Cipher:\n",

    "To be clear the top row is the character set with each characters index being shown, and below is the character that gets mapped to the character above when encrypted. Now after applying the key 12, as you can see the multiplicative cipher changes the indexes, however they are not all unique, in fact because of modular arithmatic after the originial letter indexed 12 the each letter is indexed the same way as the first 12. This as you may guess, is a big issue as when trying to decrypt a message using the above key how do we know whever the letter \"A\" should when decrypted become \"A\" again or \"N\". It is impossible to know this, so to avoid this we must use a key that is coprime to the length of our character set this way no overlapping letters will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how the Multiplicative Cipher works, the Affine Cipher is easy to understand. When using the Affine Cipher we need two keys, one key which we use for the encrypting the message using the Multiplicative Cipher that we will call \"Multkey\" and another for the Caesar Cipher that we will call \"Caesarkey\". If we want to encrypt using the Affine Cipher we first apply the Multiplicative Cipher to the message (essentially we multiply the index of each character by the Multkey) and then we apply the Caesar Cipher to the new message (Just add Caesar key to the index of each character), again we do this all modulo the length of the character set. If instead we want to decrypt using the Affine Cipher, instead we subtract the Ceasarkey from the index of each character in the message, and then multiply each index by the modular inverse of the Multikey and do this all modulo the length of the character set too. We have spoken about modular inverses earlier, so we know that if we multiply our Multikey by it's modular inverse \"m\" we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $Multikey \\times m \\equiv 1 mod(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the length of our character set. Thus to see why this decryption process works lets say our Multikey is $M$ and it's modular inverse is $m$, let $n$ be the length of our character set, $a$ our Caesar key and finally $i$ the index of a character in the message we wish to encrypt. When encrypting $i$ we will get a new index we will call $e$ and we calculate this as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $e = (iM + a) mod(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to see how we get the original index when decrypting see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $i = (m \\times (e - a))mod(n) = (m \\times (iM))mod(n) = imod(n) = i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we should now understand how encryption and decryption works using the Affine Cipher, so now we will create the functions that implement the Affine Cipher."

    "The method for cracking the Affine Cipher is the same as the method we used for the Caesar Cipher, we use a \"Brute-force Attack\". The reason for this is because, there are a limited amount of keys you can use for the Affine Cipher, in fact if $n$ is the length of our character set, there are only $n^{2}$ possible keys. The reason being for this is simple, it is because we work modulo $n$ and we have a choice for the Multikey of which there are $n$ possible values it can take due to working modulo $n$ (actually a bit less since we wouldn't expect this to be a value of 1 or a value such that gcd(Multikey,$n$) is not equal to 1), and for the Caesarkey we also have $n$ possible keys. Thus the amount of combinations of keys we can have is equal to at most:\n",

This means we don't have to generate massive primes which would take longer. The security benefits to this method are still the same as the RSA method; the code is still hard to crack due to the size of the prime numbers used. To even further improve the security of the message you could generate new private and public keys for each segment and send a list of private and public keys instead of one.

      "take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\n",

      "falling down a very deep well.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she\n",

      "wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look\n",
      "down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\n",
      "see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\n",
      "noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\n",
      "here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She\n",
      "took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was\n",
      "labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it\n",
      "was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\n",

      "fell past it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\n",
      "shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\n",
      "all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\n",

      "me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\n",
      "you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her\n",
      "lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good\n",
      "opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to\n",
      "listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,\n",
      "that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\n",
      "or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\n",
      "or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to\n",
      "say.)\n",
      "\n",
      "  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\n",
      "THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the\n",
      "people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I\n",
      "think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this\n",
      "time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\n",
      "have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\n",
      "Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\n",
      "to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling\n",

      "her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were\n",
      "down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\n",
      "you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\n",
      "But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\n",
      "rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of\n",
      "way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do\n",
      "bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\n",
      "question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\n",
      "that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she\n",
      "was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very\n",
      "earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a\n",
      "bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\n",
      "sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a\n",
      "moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her\n",
      "was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in\n",
      "sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\n",
      "away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\n",
      "say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\n",
      "it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the\n",
      "corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found\n",
      "herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\n",
      "hanging from the roof.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;\n",
      "and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\n",
      "other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\n",
      "wondering how she was ever to get out again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of\n",
      "solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,\n",
      "and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\n",
      "doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\n",
      "the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of\n",
      "them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low\n",
      "curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little\n",
      "door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key\n",
      "in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small\n",
      "passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\n",
      "looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.\n",
      "How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about\n",
      "among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\n",
      "she could not even get her head though the doorway; `and even if\n",
      "my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\n",
      "very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\n",
      "I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only\n",
      "know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\n",
      "had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\n",
      "things indeed were really impossible.\n",
      "\n",
      "  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she\n",
      "went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on\n",
      "it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\n",
      "telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\n",
      "certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\n",
      "of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'\n",
      "beautifully printed on it in large letters.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\n",
      "Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\n",
      "first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked \"poison\" or not';\n",
      "for she had read several nice little histories about children who\n",
      "had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\n",
      "things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\n",
      "their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\n",
      "will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your\n",
      "finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had\n",
      "never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\n",
      "`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "\n",
      "  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\n",
      "to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\n",
      "of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast\n",
      "turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\n",
      "it off.\n",
      "\n",

      "  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up\n",
      "like a telescope.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and\n",
      "her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right\n",
      "size for going though the little door into that lovely garden.\n",
      "First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\n",
      "going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\n",
      "this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\n",
      "going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be\n",
      "like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is\n",
      "like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember\n",
      "ever having seen such a thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided\n",
      "on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when\n",
      "she got to the door, she found he had forgotten the little golden\n",
      "key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she\n",
      "could not possibly reach it:  she could see it quite plainly\n",
      "through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the\n",
      "legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had\n",
      "tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and\n",
      "cried.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to\n",
      "herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'\n",
      "She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very\n",
      "seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\n",
      "severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\n",
      "trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game\n",
      "of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious\n",
      "child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no\n",
      "use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,\n",
      "there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\n",
      "person!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\n",
      "the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\n",
      "which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.\n",
      "`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,\n",
      "I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep\n",
      "under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\n",
      "don't care which happens!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which\n",
      "way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\n",
      "feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\n",
      "find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally\n",
      "happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the\n",
      "way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,\n",
      "that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the\n",
      "common way.\n",

      "out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one\n",

      "by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that\n",
      "rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,\n",

      "get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,\n",
      "and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was\n",
      "just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something\n",
      "of the sort.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are\n",

      "I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!\n",

      "away!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear\n",
      "whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer\n",
      "honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at\n",
      "last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in\n",
      "the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more\n",
      "sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there\n",
      "must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for\n",
      "pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I\n",
      "don't want to stay in here any longer!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at\n",
      "last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a\n",
      "good many voice all talking together:  she made out the words:\n",
      "`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;\n",
      "Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up\n",
      "at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half\n",

      "narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and\n",
      "waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what\n",
      "sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close\n",
      "above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one\n",
      "sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes\n",
      "Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the\n",
      "hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold\n",
      "up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?\n",
      "What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'\n",

      "Dinah at you!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to\n",
      "herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any\n",
      "sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they\n",
      "began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A\n",
      "barrowful will do, to begin with.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to\n",
      "doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came\n",
      "rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.\n",
      "`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,\n",
      "`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead\n",
      "silence.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all\n",
      "turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright\n",
      "idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she\n",
      "thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it\n",
      "can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I\n",
      "suppose.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find\n",
      "that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small\n",
      "enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and\n",
      "found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.\n",
      "The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by\n",
      "two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.\n",
      "They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she\n",
      "ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a\n",
      "thick wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she\n",
      "wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;\n",
      "and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.\n",
      "I think that will be the best plan.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and\n",
      "simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the\n",
      "smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering\n",
      "about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over\n",
      "her head made her look up in a great hurry.\n",
      "\n",
      "  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round\n",
      "eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.\n",
      "`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried\n",
      "hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the\n",
      "time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it\n",
      "would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of\n",
      "stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped\n",
      "into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,\n",
      "and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice\n",
      "dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run\n",
      "over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy\n",
      "made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in\n",
      "its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very\n",
      "like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every\n",
      "moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle\n",
      "again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the\n",
      "stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long\n",
      "way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat\n",
      "down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its\n",
      "mouth, and its great eyes half shut.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;\n",
      "so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out\n",
      "of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the\n",
      "distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she\n",
      "leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself\n",
      "with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks\n",
      "very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh\n",
      "dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let\n",

      "the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,\n",
      "about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under\n",
      "it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her\n",
      "that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of\n",
      "the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large\n",
      "caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,\n",

      "\n",
      "  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the\n",
      "conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's\n",
      "making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,\n",
      "very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not\n",
      "think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in\n",
      "a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something\n",
      "important to say!'\n",
      "\n",

      "she could.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else\n",
      "to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth\n",
      "hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but\n",
      "at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth\n",
      "again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as\n",
      "I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I've tried to say \"HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,\" but it\n",
      "all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Repeat, \"YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,\"' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice folded her hands, and began:--\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,\n",
      "      `And your hair has become very white;\n",
      "    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--\n",
      "      Do you think, at your age, it is right?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,\n",
      "      `I feared it might injure the brain;\n",
      "    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\n",
      "      Why, I do it again and again.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,\n",
      "      And have grown most uncommonly fat;\n",
      "    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--\n",
      "      Pray, what is the reason of that?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n",
      "      `I kept all my limbs very supple\n",
      "    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--\n",
      "      Allow me to sell you a couple?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak\n",
      "      For anything tougher than suet;\n",
      "    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--\n",
      "      Pray how did you manage to do it?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,\n",
      "      And argued each case with my wife;\n",
      "    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\n",
      "      Has lasted the rest of my life.'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose\n",
      "      That your eye was as steady as ever;\n",
      "    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--\n",
      "      What made you so awfully clever?'\n",
      "\n",
      "    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'\n",
      "      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!\n",

      "words have got altered.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.\n",

      "  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n",
      "\n",

      "`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in\n",
      "her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you\n",
      "wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched\n",
      "height to be.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar\n",
      "angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three\n",
      "inches high).\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.\n",

      "easily offended!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it\n",
      "put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.\n",
      "In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its\n",
      "mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got\n",
      "down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely\n",
      "remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and\n",
      "the other side will make you grow shorter.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to\n",
      "herself.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had\n",
      "asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a\n",
      "minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as\n",
      "it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.\n",
      "However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they\n",
      "would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a\n",
      "little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment\n",
      "she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her\n",
      "foot!\n",
      "\n",
      "  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but\n",
      "she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking\n",
      "rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.\n",
      "Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was\n",
      "hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and\n",
      "managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of\n",
      "delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she\n",
      "found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could\n",
      "see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which\n",
      "seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay\n",
      "far below her.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where\n",
      "HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I\n",
      "can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no\n",
      "result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the\n",
      "distant green leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her\n",
      "head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted\n",
      "to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,\n",
      "like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a\n",
      "graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which\n",
      "she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she\n",
      "had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a\n",
      "hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating\n",
      "her violently with its wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more\n",
      "subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every\n",
      "way, and nothing seems to suit them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said\n",
      "Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've\n",
      "tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but\n",
      "those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no\n",
      "use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the\n",
      "Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and\n",
      "day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was\n",
      "beginning to see its meaning.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued\n",
      "the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was\n",
      "thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come\n",
      "wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm\n",
      "a--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're\n",
      "trying to invent something!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she\n",
      "remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the\n",
      "deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my\n",
      "time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a\n",
      "serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be\n",
      "telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very\n",
      "truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as\n",
      "serpents do, you know.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why\n",
      "then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent\n",
      "for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of\n",
      "adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and\n",
      "what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a\n",
      "serpent?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm\n",
      "not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't\n",
      "want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it\n",
      "settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the\n",
      "trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled\n",
      "among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and\n",
      "untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the\n",
      "pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very\n",
      "carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and\n",
      "growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had\n",
      "succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\n",
      "\n",
      "  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,\n",
      "that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a\n",
      "few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,\n",
      "there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes\n",
      "are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to\n",
      "another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next\n",
      "thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be\n",
      "done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an\n",
      "open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n",
      "`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come\n",
      "upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their\n",
      "wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did\n",
      "not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself\n",
      "down to nine inches high.\n",

      "with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,\n",
      "with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,\n",

      "\n",
      "  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great\n",
      "letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to\n",
      "the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An\n",
      "invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman\n",
      "repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the\n",
      "words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess\n",
      "to play croquet.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled\n",
      "together.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and\n",
      "that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the\n",
      "door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise\n",
      "inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was\n",
      "a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling\n",
      "and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish\n",
      "or kettle had been broken to pieces.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'\n",
      "\n",

      "on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For\n",
      "instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let\n",
      "you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time\n",
      "he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But\n",
      "perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so\n",
      "VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might\n",
      "answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'\n",

      "  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate\n",
      "came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just\n",
      "grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees\n",
      "behind him.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,\n",
      "exactly as if nothing had happened.\n",

      "  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n",

      "\n",
      "  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of\n",

      "into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.\n",
      "\n",
      "  No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,\n",

      "much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be\n",

      "\n",
      "  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "            \"Up above the world you fly,\n",
      "            Like a tea-tray in the sky.\n",

      "\n",
      "Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n",
      "`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,\n",
      "`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, \"He's murdering the\n",

      "\n",

      "`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so\n",
      "many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always\n",
      "tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice\n",
      "ventured to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,\n",
      "yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady\n",
      "tells us a story.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at\n",
      "the proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,\n",
      "Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great\n",
      "interest in questions of eating and drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a\n",
      "minute or two.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently\n",
      "remarked; `they'd have been ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways\n",
      "of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went\n",
      "on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very\n",
      "earnestly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so\n",
      "I can't take more.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very\n",
      "easy to take MORE than nothing.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked\n",
      "triumphantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped\n",
      "herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the\n",
      "Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the\n",
      "bottom of a well?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and\n",
      "then said, `It was a treacle-well.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but\n",
      "the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse\n",
      "sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the\n",
      "story for yourself.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt\n",
      "again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he\n",
      "consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they\n",
      "were learning to draw, you know--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this\n",
      "time.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move\n",
      "one place on.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the\n",
      "March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather\n",
      "unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the\n",
      "only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a\n",
      "good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset\n",
      "the milk-jug into his plate.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began\n",
      "very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw\n",
      "the treacle from?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so\n",
      "I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,\n",
      "stupid?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not\n",
      "choosing to notice this last remark.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse\n",
      "go on for some time without interrupting it.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and\n",
      "rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew\n",
      "all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why with an M?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why not?' said the March Hare.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was silent.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going\n",
      "off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up\n",
      "again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an\n",
      "M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--\n",
      "you know you say things are \"much of a muchness\"--did you ever\n",
      "see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I\n",

      "\n",
      "  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.\n",
      "\n",
      "  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got\n",
      "up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep\n",
      "instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her\n",
      "going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that\n",
      "they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were\n",

      "\n",
      "  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she\n",

      "\n",

      "unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to\n",
      "work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her\n",
      "pocked) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the\n",

      "\n",
      "  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped\n",
      "like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and\n",
      "feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were\n",
      "ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the\n",
      "soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were\n",
      "ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand\n",
      "in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next\n",
      "came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice\n",
      "recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous\n",
      "manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without\n",
      "noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the\n",
      "King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\n",
      "grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on\n",
      "her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember\n",

      "what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people\n",

      "reply.\n",

      "was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether\n",

      "  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.\n",

      "I said \"What for?\"'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a\n",

      "frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came\n",
      "rather late, and the Queen said--'\n",

      "and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up\n",
      "against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or\n",
      "two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a\n",
      "curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and\n",
      "furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live\n",
      "flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to\n",
      "stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her\n",
      "flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,\n",
      "comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,\n",
      "but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened\n",
      "out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it\n",
      "WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a\n",
      "puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:\n",
      "and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,\n",
      "it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled\n",
      "itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,\n",
      "there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she\n",
      "wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers\n",
      "were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the\n",
      "ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very\n",
      "difficult game indeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,\n",

      "  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering\n",

      "first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to\n",

      "least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,\n",
      "and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the\n",
      "game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The\n",
      "Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and\n",
      "no more of it appeared.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather\n",
      "a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't\n",
      "hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in\n",
      "particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and\n",
      "you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;\n",

      "finishing the game.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Queen smiled and passed on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and\n",
      "looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n",
      "\n",

      "of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and\n",
      "she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in\n",

      "  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to\n",
      "settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,\n",

      "to make out exactly what they said.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,\n",

      "taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave\n",
      "off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour\n",

      "execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to\n",
      "Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'\n",

      "history,'\n",

      "voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,\n",
      "THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite\n",
      "unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.\n",
      "\n",
      "  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the\n",
      "sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)\n",
      "`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to\n",
      "see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and\n",
      "see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,\n",
      "leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like\n",
      "the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would\n",
      "be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage\n",
      "Queen:  so she waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the\n",
      "Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'\n",
      "said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they\n",
      "never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Everybody says \"come on!\" here,' thought Alice, as she went\n",
      "slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,\n",
      "never!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the\n",
      "distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,\n",
      "as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart\n",
      "would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she\n",
      "asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the\n",
      "same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got\n",
      "no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with\n",
      "large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to\n",
      "know your history, she do.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow\n",
      "tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've\n",
      "finished.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice\n",
      "thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he\n",
      "doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was\n",
      "a real Turtle.'\n",
      "\n",
      "  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only\n",
      "by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and\n",
      "the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very\n",
      "nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your\n",
      "interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be\n",
      "more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more\n",
      "calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to\n",
      "school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call\n",
      "him Tortoise--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock\n",
      "Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple\n",
      "question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and\n",
      "looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At\n",
      "last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!\n",
      "Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe\n",
      "it--'\n",
      "\n",
      "  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak\n",
      "again.  The Mock Turtle went on.\n",
      "\n",
      "  `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school\n",
      "every day--'\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "  `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.\n",
      "\n",

    "### Decompose Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "A good guess for the time complexity of the decompose function we are using is $O(2^p)$, where $p$ is the bit size of one of our non-trivial prime factors of $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are of the same bit size. We are able to estimate the time complexity because we have found the average runtime and average number of operations the decompose function performs and they increase by the same rate as we will explain later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the average runtime, from earlier, the mean ratio (from a sample size of 4 for each bit size) of the average run time for the decompose function performs for consecutive $N's$ is the roughly the same at $2$. Furthermore, the standard deviation for the ratio is small implying that the ratio roughly stays constant. In addition, the graphs for the average decompose run time is in the shape of $y = 2^x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for consecutive $N's$, the average number of operations for the decompose function roughly doubles too and the ratio has a low standard deviation too, as seen above, meaning this ratio stays constant. Since, the average number of operations also increases at the same rate as the average run time of the decompose function, we have a good amount of evidence to be confident that this function does have an $O(2^p)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may not necessarily be the case because our graph for the average runtimes may change drastically for larger $p$ and $q$ but it is a reasonable guess because the data points we have fit this model well. From this time complexity, we are able to extrapolate the graph and make estimates for the average decompose times for larger $N$."

    "\n",
    "It is of our best interest to be able to estimate the average decompose time because as the bit size increases for $N$, it takes longer to find the average time taken, and to find when it become infeasible, we want to find how long it takes for larger $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the average decompose time for larger values of $N$, we will plot a graph of shape $y = c \\cdot 2^x$, where $c$ is our average decompose runtime for our smallest value of $N$, this would be when $p$ and $q$ are of $10$ bit sizes. We will compute a better average time for this value of $N$ using a larger sample size of $20$, because this value is our scale factor for the graph so will affect all values in our graph a lot so it must be as accurate as possible.

    "### The Purpose of the Decompose Function (Security)\n",
    "The purpose of the decompose function is to find the prime decomposition of a number. In terms of an RSA setting, we would be using this function to attempt to crack the private key, which are, say, primes $p$ and $q$ given the public key $N = pq$. From the public key, we are also given $e$, an auxiliary number called the exponent but the decompose function does not use this information. Therefore, it is clear to see that the decompose function, which does not use the exponent will not be as efficient at finding the prime decomposition as a function which does use this extra information, like the RSA decryption method mentioned in the previous question.\n",
    "Furthermore, since the private key in an RSA setting is usually 2048 bits long, the decompose function is not effective at all at cracking this. This is because, as we discussed earlier in the time complexity section, due to the decompose function being $O(2^p)$, it is effective at cracking short private keys but becomes ineffective very quickly as the bit length of the private key increases.\n",

Indeed, the factoring record is the factorisation of the $829$-bit RSA-$250$, set in February 2020. However, with quantum computers currently being developed which are a lot faster than traditional computers, RSA and many other traditional encryption methods used today may become obsolete; a huge security issue. Luckily, there are already a few quantum-resistant security protocols which are being developed to work around this encryption problem so hopefully these encryption methods will be developed before quantum computers because otherwise it would result in a security disaster."

    "### What is The Pollard Rho Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pollard Rho method is an algorithm used for factorising large composite integers, $N$. It has been heuristically claimed, but not rigorously, that the Pollard Rho method works in runs at a time of $O(N^{0.25})$. It is very effective at finding small factors of a composite integer. Since we are primarily concerned with factorising $N$ = $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, since this is what we do in an RSA setting, we will be looking at this case and compare how efficient the Pollard Rho method is in comparison to the decompose function. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps in the Pollard Rho method. These are described below. This method has been taken from the Handbook of Applied Cryptography Chapter $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to generate a random sequence of integers which are less than the composite integer we are factorising, $N$. This is done using using the function \n",
    "> $g(m) = (m^2 + 1) \\pmod N$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A starting value $m_0 = 2$, is chosen and each pair of integers in the sequence is generated using  \n",
    ">$(m_{i+1}, m_{2(i + 1)}) = (g(m_i), g(g(m_{2i})))$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are choosing to compute pairs of integers to increase space efficiency; this works due to Floyd's Cycle Finding algorithm which we will discuss in more detail later. We compute the sequence until we get to $(m_k, m_{2k})$ where $k \\approx 10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$. We have chosen this value of $k$ because it has been stated in the question that if we iterate our next step this number of times then we find with high probability, a non-trivial prime factor of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find the greatest common divisor ($gcd$) of the difference between the pairs we have generated in the sequence and the number we're attempting to factorise, $N$. We have three different cases here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = 1$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$ where $k \\approx 10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above statement holds, we test it for the next $i$ in our set and we keep iterating this until we get a different value for our $gcd$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If next case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$ and some $1 < p < N$ $\\iff m_{2i} \\equiv m_i \\pmod p$ $\\iff p \\mid m_{2i} - m_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have found a non-trivial prime factor of N in this case and this non-trivial prime factor is indeed the value of $p$. This outcome occurs with very high probability. This is because we expect all $(m_i, m_{2i})$ such that $1 \\leq i < k$ to be distinct modulo $N$ so we expect to find at least one pair $(m_i, m_{2i})$ where $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$ and $1 < p < N$. Since we are concerned with the case where $N = pq$, we simply find our other prime factor by dividing $N$ by $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = N$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is equivalent to $\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid = 0$ meaning that there is a pair in the sequence that are equal to eachother (this happens with low probability). Therefore, by Floyd's cycle finding algorithm, $m_i$ becomes cyclic at the first time $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = N$; after this point, no matter how many times we iterate the Pollard Rho method, we will not find any more factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Pollard Rho method keeps iterating $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N)$ until we reach one of these three criteria. Either until we find that $1 < gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) < N$, in which we return a non-trivial factor of $N$. Or until we compute $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N)$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$, and if this doesn't return a value between $0$ and $N$ each time, we return a failure. Or, finally, if $gcd(\\mid m_{2k} - m_k \\mid, N) = N$ in which case we also return a failure. In the event that we return a failure, one possible solution is to try altering our function $g(m) = (m^2 + 1)$ $mod$ $N$ to $g(m) = (m^2 + c)$ $mod$ $N$ where $c$ is any integer such that $c \\neq 0, -2, 1$. This produces a different sequence of values and in this new sequence, we find $m_i \\equiv m_{2i} \\pmod p$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, and hence a non-trivial prime factor of N with high probability."

    "### Birthday Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pollard Rho method takes advantage of the birthday paradox in order to find pairs in a large sequence of numbers which satisfy this criteria: $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$.\n",
    "So understanding this paradox is the key to learning how the Pollard Rho method works,so we will briefly explain this concept here. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paradox is concerned with the probability in a set of $n$ randomly chosen people, some pair of them will share the same birthday. It is a paradox because it turns out this probability is a lot higher than you would expect. For example, in a room of $23$ people, there is a $50$% chance that at least two people share the same birthday and in a room of $75$ people, there is a $99.9$% chance of at least two people sharing the same birthday. \n",
    "By some combinations mathematics, in a room of $23$ people, there are $253$ pairs; this is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\frac{23 \\cdot 22}{2} = 253$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the chance of two people having different birthdays is clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$1 - \\frac{1}{365} = \\frac{364}{365}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the chance of all $23$ people in the room having different birthdays is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\frac{364}{365}^{253} = 0.4995$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the chance of two people having the same birthday is about $50/50$ and it is easy to see that this probability exponentially increases as the number of people in the room increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "By the birthday paradox, it follows that we find a non-trivial prime factor of N with probability $1/2$ in $O(\\sqrt p) \\leq O(N^{0.25})$ time, assuming that the sequence we generate is truly random. However, we only have a heuristic claim that the Pollard Rho method has the same time complexity and a rigorous analysis of this method still remains open. A time complexity is an asymptotic upper bound, because it bounds the growth of the running time for large enough input sizes. However, it is important to note that this is not necessarily an asymptotically tight bound. For example, in our case, the running time for the Pollard Rho method grows no faster than $c \\cdot N^{0.25}$ for some constant $c$; it could in fact grow a lot slower than at a rate of $N^{0.25}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the function $g:S \\rightarrow S$ as we stated earlier and since $S$ is a finite set of cardinality $N$, this function will eventually cycle. By some number theory of random numbers, we have that the expected length of the tail of the sequence of integers $m_i$ is $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 8}$ and the expected length of the endlessly repeating cycle is also $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 8}$. The method in which one would initially think to find duplicates in the sequence is by storing all the integers in the sequence, and checking for duplicates in a pairwise fashion (i.e. checking all possible pairs of the sequence). By the birthday problem, the expected number of inputs until a pair of integers $m_i$ and $m_j$ are equal to eachother is $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 2}$. Therefore, this method of finding when the sequence becomes cyclic takes up $O(\\sqrt N)$ memory and $O(\\sqrt N)$ time. For example, if we had the sequence of integers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$ where $k = N^{0.25}$ where $N \\sim 10^{30}$ and did pairwise comparisons we would have to store $10^8$ numbers in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to reduce the storage requirements of the Pollard Rho method drastically to only two numbers using Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm so in our code, we will employ this version of the Pollard Rho method. We will discuss how the Floyd's cycle finding algorithm works in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm allows us to easily find when the sequence cycles using only pairs of numbers from the sequence and we only need to store one pair at a time. Therefore, when using this algorithm, the Pollard Rho method has a space complexity of only $O(1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will proceed to explain this by analogy. Suppose we have two runners, A and B with B running twice as fast as A, where they start at the same position. Then, when B has overtaken A we know that B has cycled around at least once so we can stop the algorithm at this point. In the analogy, runner A is $a = g(a)$ from our pollard_rho function below and runner B is $b = g(g(b))$ from the same pollard_rho function. We know that $b$ has 'overtaken' $a$ when $\\mid a-  b \\mid = 0$ or equivalently, when $gcd(\\mid a - b \\mid,N) = N$. Therefore, at this point the sequence becomes cyclic and we can return a failure and try finding a non-trivial prime factor of $N$ by using a different function $g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Pollard Rho Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We are primarily concentrated on trying to crack the RSA key so we will focus on coding the Pollard Rho method so it is able to factor $N = pq$ for $p$ and $q$ where they are $k$ bit random primes. "

    "From our graphs which plot the average run time of these two factoring algorithms for $N$ = $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we can see that the average decompose run time is consistently lower for smaller bit sizes of $N$. However, when $N$ reaches $33$ bits, the average run time for the Pollard Rho function is lower than the average decompose run time for the first time.  From this bit size, the difference between the run time for the Pollard Rho function and the decompose function increases, depicting how the Pollard Rho method is far more effective than the decompose function with large bit sizes of $N$."

    "As we can see above, the operations actually performed by the function is close to this worst-case scenario often so it turns out the graphs look pretty much identical. Therefore, since the worst-case scenario is where we iterate the function $10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$ times, the graph has this shape, which would suggest that the time complexity is indeed $O(N^{0.25})$. Now, we will check if the average run time for the Pollard Rho also has this shape, and then we have strong evidence to support the time complexity being $O(N^{0.25})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the worst-case scenario and actual scenario are so similar is because I have coded the $N's$ to be generated such that the two non-trivial prime factors $p$ and $q$ are of the same bit length, meaning that the factors are quite large, especially for a larger bit size of $N$. This makes it more of a worst case scenario because as I stated at the start of this section, Pollard Rho is most effective when factorising small factors."

    "### Sophie Germain Prime\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before discussing the Diffie-Hellman protcol, we will be discussing what a Sophie Germain prime is and why it is useful in many situations for cryptography. Simply a Sophie Germain prime is a prime $q$ such that $p = 2q+1$ is also a prime which is called the complimentary safe prime of the $q$. The complimentary safe prime is very useful due to one of the properties it exhibits, to see this property we look at the prime decomposition of $p-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $p - 1 = (2q + 1) - 1 = 2q$\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this we already have the prime decompostion of $p-1$, it is simply $2q$. Now if you're wondering why this is useful, we must first discuss primitive roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive root of a prime $p$ is a value we will call $a$, where $a$ is an integer such that the smallest value $l$, known as the multiplicative order of $a$ relative to $p$, for which,\n",
    "\n",
    "> $a^{l} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "is true is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $l = p-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "It was proven by the German mathmatician Gauss, that all primes have a primitive root and that the amount of primitive roots a prime has is equal to  $\\phi{(p-1)}$, where  $\\phi$ is Eulers totient, so we do not have to worry about a lack of primitive roots. Now a useful fact we can use is that the multiplicative order of $a mod(p)$ will always be a divisior of $p-1$. Thus we have found the use for a Sophie Germain prime, since we know the prime factorization of $p-1$ where $p$ is the complementary safe prime to some Sophie Germain prime $p$, we can use this to easily test if a value $a$ is a primitive root of the complementary safe prime. To do this all we have to do is check if for the safe prime p, any of the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{1} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{2} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{\\frac{(p-1)}{2}} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have to check this since we know the multiplicative order of $a mod(p)$ is a divisor of $2q$, so the multiplicative order must be $1,2$ or $q$, hence if none of the above are true, then the multiplicative order is $2q$ which means $a$ is a primitive root of our safe prime. This will get us started on the Diffie-Hellman protocol, so first we write a function to get Sophie Germain primes, and their complementary safe primes along with a function to get primitive roots for complementary safe primes."

    "### The Deffie-Hellman Protocol - First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the first steps of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, we will discuss what the protocol does. This protocol allows two or more parties (In cryptography the first two parties are usually referred to as Alice and Bob) to generate a shared secret key that each party knows, and has access to, without ever having to communicate the key in any form. The importance here is that the secret key is not communicated between parties, because if it is, the key is then suseptible to being observed by an outside party. Thus from this it is easy to see why the Deffie-Hellman protocol is so useful. An example of one of the main uses of this is that it allows parties say Alice and Bob to send encrypted messages to each other using the secret key and then decrypt these message using the same secret key. Hence if an outside party was to observe one of these messages, without the secret key they will not be able to read the message (at least without knowing how they encrypted the message and any potential cracks for this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the Diffie-Hellman protocol work? First we will look at the two party situation, and we will call these parties Alice and Bob. To begin we need both Alice and Bob to have access to a very large safe prime $p$ (when discussing this protcol we will be using a 256 bit prime) and a primtive root of the prime we will call $g$, however unlike the secret key, $p$ and $g$ can be made public for anyone to have access to. Now when dicussing how the protocol works, you may soon notice that the safe prime Bob and Alice make public does not need to be a safe prime or even a prime at all and the primitive root can be any number for the protocol to work. Despite this we use a safe prime and a primitive root because hackers can calculate discrete logarithms (for example by using the Pohlig-Hellman protocol) to work out the secret key, however the algorithms hackers use is much faster if the number we make public here is not a safe prime, thus for security purposes we use a safe prime and one of the primitive roots for this prime. Hence by using our \"sgrandprime\" function above, we can generate a safe prime for Alice and Bob to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the next step we want Alice and Bob to generate a private key for themselves, they can not tell each other about these keys nor anyone else, this is for them and only them to know and have access to. This private key is a random number, for alice we will call her private key $a$ and for Bob $b$, however the larger the private key again the better as it makes it harder for hackers to get access to the secret key so again we generate 256 bit random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will generate the safe prime $p$ and primitive root $g$ using the functions from before, also we will make a function to generate our the private keys $a$ and $b$."

    "\n",
    "Once Alice and Bob have their private keys, their next step is to generate their public keys. We will call the public key Alice generates $A$ and Bobs $B$. To generate these public keys we do the following calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$A = g^{a}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$B = g^{b}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "After we complete these calculations, we now have the public keys for Alice and Bob. The next step is for Alice to send her public key $A$ to Bob, and for Bob to send $B$ to Alice. Though this seems like a compromising step for a protocol based around security, for a hacker to use the public keys to get the private keys it is very difficult because $p$ is a safe prime and $g$ is a primitive root for $p$. By using these numbers a hacker has a very small amount of attack vectors when trying to find the private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Alice has Bobs public key and Bob has Alices, we calculate the secret key that we will now call $S$. When calculating the secret key this must be done seperately by both Bob and Alice in private as to not let anyone gain access to the secret key. For Alice to generate the $S$ she must do the following calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = B^{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and Bob must generate $S$ by calculating:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = A^{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This at first look may not be entirely obvious as to why the calculation Alice does calculates the same secret key as Bobs calculations. However this is due to simple properties of modulo exponents, as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = B^{a} = (g^{b}mod(p))^{a} = g^{ba}mod(p) = (g^{a}mod(p))^{b} = A^{b} = S$\n",
    "\n",
    "However the calculations above only apply to a two party system. Luckily for us this generalizes quite simply for an $n$ party system. As before we have our safe prime $p$ and a primitive root of $p$ we call $g$, and all $n$ parties must generate their own private key in the same way as before and their relative public key in the same way as before. The only difference for an $n$ party system comes when calculating the secret key $S$. To do this let us label the n private keys generated as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $P_{1}, P_{2}, ... , P_{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all n parties have already calculated their relative public keys, which are as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $g^{P_{1}}mod(p), g^{P_{2}}mod(p), ... , g^{P_{n}}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our final secret key $S$ to be of the same form before, meaning we have $g^{x}mod(p)$, where $x$ is the product of all private keys involved. Hence to achieve this in an n party case, we first label each party $1,2,..n$ and the $i^{th}$ party must send their public key to the $(i+1)^{th}$ party also party $n$ must give his public key to party $1$. Then each member must generate their new public key as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $(g^{P_{n}}mod(p))^{P_{1}}, g^{P_{1}}mod(p))^{P_{2}}, ... , g^{P_{n-1}}mod(p))^{P_{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this has been completed, we again get each party to send their new public key to the party ahead of them. We repeat this process a total of $n-1$ times, and the final calculation will give each party the secret key $S$ which for the $i{th}$ party will be of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $(g^{P_{i-1}P_{i-2}...P_{1}P_{n}...P_{i+1}}mod(p))^{P_{i}} = g^{P_{1}P_{2}...P_{n}}mod(p) = S$\n",

However as mentioned when implementing the The Diffie-Hellman protocol in a real world scenorio these calculations should be done in private for one person. This means you should not use the functions as I have above to calculate private keys, public keys and the secret key for each party in the system on one computer. Instead you will use the functions to only calculate everything for yourself in privacy, as if everything was done from one computer, this would negate the entire process."

    "As discussed earlier in the project we concluded from the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) that for any security method it should take over $2$ years to crack. In this case to crack the Diffie-Hellman protocol (solving the discrete logarithm problem) should take over $2$ years, when the function takes longer than two years to solve this is the point at which the function becomes infeasible. As we don't have time to test what bit size takes over 2 years we will have to use the data gathered and extrapolate. Due to the nature of extrapolation these will be approximations.\n",
