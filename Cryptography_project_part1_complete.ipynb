    "Firstly before getting into different types of ciphers and how to crack these ciphers, we will define a cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is simply an algorithm used to encrypt data, and since we use an algorithm, we can reverse this algorithm to decrypt already encrypted data given that we have enough information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms used for encryption can be very simple, in fact the first cipher we look at, The Caesar Cipher, was used by the Roman leader Julian Caeser to encrypt messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of cipher known as a substitution cipher, this means that each letter (this can include symbols, numbers and pretty much any character you want) is replaced by another letter. The Caesar does this by first choosing a key which can be a numebr from 1 to 26 (this can be a larger range as you add more characters as you'll see) let's say we choose the key 12. Now you align the number 12, which has the letter L associated with it, with the letter A and shift everything else along with it as shown below.\n",

    "### Cracking The Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Although The Caesar Cipher would of been useful before the age of computers, today it is very rare in usage other than for introductions to Ciphers. The reason for this is because it is simply too easy for a computer to \"Brute-force attack\" the cipher. A Bruter-force attack is simple, it is an algorithm which attempts every possible key for a message and outputs the decryption of that message. In more advandced ciphers this is not a feasible method for cracking an encrypted message. However since the Caesar Cipher has a very small amount of possible keys, in our case only 95, it takes very little time to attempt every key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now reading through every decrypted message to check if it is the original may still take a while, so we can check some properties the original message might display. For example if we know the most commonly used letter in the english language and the most commonly used word, we could quickly check if the decrypted message contains this word or has the same most common letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency, which we will use again later, we see that \"e\" is the most common letter, making up about 12.702% of all used letters. Also using data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English, we see that \"the\" is the most common word in the english language. From this we can check if the most common letter in our decrypted message is \"e\", or if the word \"the\" is contained within our decrypted message. If it is then we could highlight this message, which will allow us to see messages which our more likely to be the true message, and save us time. This is a technique we will go more in depth with later, this is just basic implementation of this data.\n"

    "### The Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will look at another substitution cipher called the Vigenère Cipher. In fact the Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher, which means it uses multiple keys to encrypt the data at different points of the data. The Vigenère Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is just the Caesar Cipher applied to data multiple times with different keys at each point cycling through the same subkeys given by the key of the Vigenère Cipher. To clear this up it is easy to first follow an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a message we wish to encrypt using the Vigenère Cipher, we will use the message \"ENCRYPT THIS MESSAGE\". Now we need a key which we will use to encrypt this message, however unlike the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenère Cipher uses a collection of letters (or later we will see any character) to encrypt the message. For our example we will use the key \"SECRET\". Now each letter of our key \"SECRET\" is a subkey and we will cycle through these keys and apply the Caeser Cipher at each point in our message using the current subkey. Hence the first letter in our message is \"E\", and the first letter in our key is \"S\", so the letter \"E\" will be encrypted using the Caeser Cipher and the key \"S\". However of course S is not a number as our keys were when we previously used the Caesar Cipher, however again if you look at the table we used when discussing the Caesar Cipher, you can see the letter S has the number 19 associated with it, so this is the key we use. Thus the subkey used at each letter of the message is show below.     \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "    Vigenère key  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  | S  |    | E  | C  | R  | E  |    | T  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  |\n",
    "    Caesar subkey | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 | 19 |    | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  |    | 20 | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|       \n",
    "    Message       | E  | N  | C  | R  | Y  | P  | T  |    | T  | H  | I  | S  |    | M  | E  | S  | S  | A  | G  | E  |\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "However again as happened with the Caesar Cipher we can see that spaces must be ignored for now and all other characters but capital letters, again two versions of the Vigenère Cipher will be given, one basic and one which can as many characters as you want (In ASCII). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Although the Vigenère Cipher is similar to the Caeser Cipher, it is orders of magnitude more secure. For example with the character set above \"Alphabet\", the Caesar Cipher has only 26 keys to attempt, however the Vigenère Cipher has $26^{n}$ possible keys where $n$ is the length of the key. Thus the longer the key you use the more secure your encrypted message is, this is why we can not use the \"Brute-force Attack\" against a message encrypted with Vigenère Cipher (Technically we can however this will become very unfeisable as the length of the key increases)."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher Using The Dictionary\n",
    "Here we will begin looking at how to crack the Vigenère Cipher, as mentioned before this is more difficult to do than on a message encrypted using the Caeser Cipher as we can not simple brute-force attack the message. The problem is that if the person encrypting the message is using only the alphabet as their character set to encrypt their message, we do not know how long the key is they are using. If we were to assume the key was of length somewhere in the range [1,12] we have many keys to test, in fact we have.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\sum_{i=0}^{12} 26^{i} = 99246114928149462$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a lot more than the 26 we had for the Caesar Cipher. On top of this taking the computer a very long time, we still have no rubust criteria that we can check a decrypted message against to see if it could be the original message, and it would take an extremly long time to check all 99246114928149462 decrypted messages. To add to the seemingly impossible task of cracking this cipher, we do not know how long the key actually is, so for all we know the key may be of length 10, 100, 1000 or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus when trying to crack the Vigenère Cipher, we must go about this using a more efficent and robust method. One method we will use is called a \"Dictionary attack\", many hackers will use this method to attempt many passwords to gain access to someones account. This method depends on one key idea, that humans tend to use words for passwords or in this case for the key because words are easier to remember, however because of these dictionary attacks, this can leave your account or encryption vulnerable. The basis of these dictionary attacks is to simply attempt a very large set of words as the key to try and decrypt a message. This is very simple, as to do this we can download a text file filled with english words (The text file I will be using can be found here http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). Now all we have to do is attempt every word on this file, which on the file we will be using is 65,000 words. Though this may seem like many words you must keep in mind that even if we knew that the key was of length 4, using a brute-force attack we would still need to attempt,\n",
    "\n",
    ">$26^{4} = 4569764$ keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as I mentioned, there is one more problem we must over come, we can not manually check all 65,000 decrypted messages ourself as this will take a long time. To get around this we come up with a more robust method for checking if a message is likely the original than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a function which splits up each word (collectios of characters with a space inbetween them) in the decrypted message for a given key, and puts each individual word into a potential word list. Then for each element in the list, we want to check if this element is the same as any word in our dictionary text file which indicates that this element is a word. Thus we count how many words this message contains and then divide this by how many elements are in the potential word list, to get the percentage of words in this decrypted message are in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need a function that checks if the percentage of real words (words in the dictionary) and percentage of letters to characters in a message is above a certain threshold. If the message is above our threshold percentage, than we say there is a chance this is the original message. Hence by combining these two functions we have a more robust procedure to make sure only decrypted messages which are very likely to be the original are shown, which in effect means we only have to read a handful of wrong messages."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher (Key Lengths)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now clearly the method used above is not very efficent and has many limitations as checking 65,000 keys can still take a long time for the average computer, especially when the key used for encyption may not even be a word so will not be able to be decrypted using this method. Another problem is that if the word starts with a z for example \"zurrich\", the algorithm will try every word that comes before it alphabetically, rather than trying the most likely keys first. We now try to get past these limitations and crack the Vigenère Cipher for almost all cases as we will see, in doing this we will no longer use the basic Vigenère Cipher, instead we will use the extended version that uses any character set. The method we will be using is called \"The Babbage Attack & Kasiski Examination\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this method is to identify any repeated sequences in the enrypted message. We only count sequences of letters of 3 or more, however in this code we will limit ourselves to sequences of any length from 3 to 6 to speed up the algorithm. The reason we do this is because many words such as \"the\", as I mentioned before, are used many times in a single message, or we can notice that most verbs have the same ending \"ing\". Now if we notice that the same sequence of letters repeat multiple times, this may indicate the same letters being encrypted using the same subkey as before due to the subkey repeating. For example, if we encrypt the sentance \"You going running?\", using our Vigenère Cipher with the key \"examples\", the output is \"?hWmX\\\\ObMxTc_[ObM8\". We notice that the sequence of letters \"obM\" repeats twice. This can be explained by following the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vigenère key  | e  | x  | a  |  m | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  | a  | m  | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|     \n",
    "    Message       | Y  | o  | u  |    | g  | o  | i  | n  | g  |    | r  | u  | n  | n  | i  | n  | g  | ?  | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how in our message we have the repeated sequence \"ing\" eppear twice, and both times this is being encrypted using the \n",
    "same subkeys, \"e\", \"s\" and \"e\" respectively. This is extremely useful when trying to find the key, as we can now count the number of characters between repeats of sequences. As you can see the number of characters between the repeated sequence \"obM\" in our encrypted message is 8, counting from the first letter of the first sequence, to the letter before the beggining of the second sequence. Here it just so happens that the number of characters between the repeats is the exact same as the legnth of the key, however this will not happen all the time. Though this is not always true it is true that if the same letters in the orginial message are being encoded by the same characters in the key, than one of the factors of the distance between these two sequences must be the true key length, due to the cyclic nature of the encryption. This brings us to the next step of our method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must find the factors of the distance between repeated sequences. To show how we do this we will look at a longer encrypted message given below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"'kGmj\\[sMhK\\XlXiTgK\\XlRUZ^Tme\\JU_8a7wcKsH^G\\p_KUJbPUpNHc[madfefsjTaOpYUhekGQV[Z`_&a7wZehXrK\\XlSme[GaelZcelVOcaef[gPW_Ts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can check for youself using the functions below, this encrypted message has four repeated sequences \"K\\\\X\", \"\\\\XL\", \"A7W\" and \"K\\\\XL\". Now the distances between these repeated sequences are 8, 48, 72 and 80. In this part of the method as I mentioned we get the factors of the distances between the sequences, however we only want the factors that occur most, as these are more likely to be the true key length. In this case the most likely key lengths would be 2, 4 and 8 as they are factors of all 4 distances. Our next step will be to get every second, fourth and eigth letter, however before doing this we will create functions to carry out our method thus far.\n",

We will have to do this for all key lengths we think could potentially be correct, which we set to be limited to the 5 most likely above. This is very simple for us to do, we just look at our message and choose every $N^{th}$ character starting from the first character of the message. We then do this again starting from the second character of the message, and repeat this up to the $N-1$ character in the message. Again we repeat this for each potential key length.

Our next step will be deciding which characters are most likely to be our subkey.\n",

We do this by checking if the 6 most frequent letters in our decrypted message and the 6 least frequent letters match the data .

All that is left to do is attempt every likely key length along with every combition of likely characters. Though the entire purpose of using the Babbage Attack & Kasiski Examination was to avoid going about cracking the cipher using a Brute-force attack, this allows us to attempt orders of magnitude less possible combinations for keys. For example if we knew the key was of length 7, using just a Brute-force attack, we would need to attempt\n",

However I feel it is noteworth to mention the fact that if the encrypter uses a key the same length of the message, the message is uncrackable without attempting every possible key length and combination. Thus this is not a full proof method to cracking the cipher, however it is very good compared to just randomly guessing keys."
