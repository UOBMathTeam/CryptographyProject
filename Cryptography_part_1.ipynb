    "Firstly before getting into different types of ciphers and how to crack these ciphers, we will define a cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is simply an algorithm used to encrypt data, and since we use an algorithm, we can reverse this algorithm to decrypt already encrypted data given that we have enough information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms used for encryption can be very simple, in fact the first cipher we look at, The Caesar Cipher, was used by the Roman leader Julian Caeser to encrypt messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of cipher known as a substitution cipher, this means that each letter (this can include symbols, numbers and pretty much any character you want) is replaced by another letter. The Caesar does this by first choosing a key which can be a numebr from 1 to 26 (this can be a larger range as you add more characters as you'll see) let's say we choose the key 12. Now you align the number 12, which has the letter L associated with it, with the letter A and shift everything else along with it as shown below.\n",

    "### Cracking The Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Although The Caesar Cipher would of been useful before the age of computers, today it is very rare in usage other than for introductions to Ciphers. The reason for this is because it is simply too easy for a computer to \"Brute-force attack\" the cipher. A Bruter-force attack is simple, it is an algorithm which attempts every possible key for a message and outputs the decryption of that message. In more advandced ciphers this is not a feasible method for cracking an encrypted message. However since the Caesar Cipher has a very small amount of possible keys, in our case only 95, it takes very little time to attempt every key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now reading through every decrypted message to check if it is the original may still take a while, so we can check some properties the original message might display. For example if we know the most commonly used letter in the english language and the most commonly used word, we could quickly check if the decrypted message contains this word or has the same most common letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency, which we will use again later, we see that \"e\" is the most common letter, making up about 12.702% of all used letters. Also using data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English, we see that \"the\" is the most common word in the english language. From this we can check if the most common letter in our decrypted message is \"e\", or if the word \"the\" is contained within our decrypted message. If it is then we could highlight this message, which will allow us to see messages which our more likely to be the true message, and save us time. This is a technique we will go more in depth with later, this is just basic implementation of this data.\n"

    "### The Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will look at another substitution cipher called the Vigenère Cipher. In fact the Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher, which means it uses multiple keys to encrypt the data at different points of the data. The Vigenère Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is just the Caesar Cipher applied to data multiple times with different keys at each point cycling through the same subkeys given by the key of the Vigenère Cipher. To clear this up it is easy to first follow an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a message we wish to encrypt using the Vigenère Cipher, we will use the message \"ENCRYPT THIS MESSAGE\". Now we need a key which we will use to encrypt this message, however unlike the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenère Cipher uses a collection of letters (or later we will see any character) to encrypt the message. For our example we will use the key \"SECRET\". Now each letter of our key \"SECRET\" is a subkey and we will cycle through these keys and apply the Caeser Cipher at each point in our message using the current subkey. Hence the first letter in our message is \"E\", and the first letter in our key is \"S\", so the letter \"E\" will be encrypted using the Caeser Cipher and the key \"S\". However of course S is not a number as our keys were when we previously used the Caesar Cipher, however again if you look at the table we used when discussing the Caesar Cipher, you can see the letter S has the number 19 associated with it, so this is the key we use. Thus the subkey used at each letter of the message is show below.     \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "    Vigenère key  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  | S  |    | E  | C  | R  | E  |    | T  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  |\n",
    "    Caesar subkey | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 | 19 |    | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  |    | 20 | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|       \n",
    "    Message       | E  | N  | C  | R  | Y  | P  | T  |    | T  | H  | I  | S  |    | M  | E  | S  | S  | A  | G  | E  |\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "However again as happened with the Caesar Cipher we can see that spaces must be ignored for now and all other characters but capital letters, again two versions of the Vigenère Cipher will be given, one basic and one which can as many characters as you want (In ASCII). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Although the Vigenère Cipher is similar to the Caeser Cipher, it is orders of magnitude more secure. For example with the character set above \"Alphabet\", the Caesar Cipher has only 26 keys to attempt, however the Vigenère Cipher has $26^{n}$ possible keys where $n$ is the length of the key. Thus the longer the key you use the more secure your encrypted message is, this is why we can not use the \"Brute-force Attack\" against a message encrypted with Vigenère Cipher (Technically we can however this will become very unfeisable as the length of the key increases)."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher Using The Dictionary\n",
    "Here we will begin looking at how to crack the Vigenère Cipher, as mentioned before this is more difficult to do than on a message encrypted using the Caeser Cipher as we can not simple brute-force attack the message. The problem is that if the person encrypting the message is using only the alphabet as their character set to encrypt their message, we do not know how long the key is they are using. If we were to assume the key was of length somewhere in the range [1,12] we have many keys to test, in fact we have.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\sum_{i=0}^{12} 26^{i} = 99246114928149462$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a lot more than the 26 we had for the Caesar Cipher. On top of this taking the computer a very long time, we still have no rubust criteria that we can check a decrypted message against to see if it could be the original message, and it would take an extremly long time to check all 99246114928149462 decrypted messages. To add to the seemingly impossible task of cracking this cipher, we do not know how long the key actually is, so for all we know the key may be of length 10, 100, 1000 or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus when trying to crack the Vigenère Cipher, we must go about this using a more efficent and robust method. One method we will use is called a \"Dictionary attack\", many hackers will use this method to attempt many passwords to gain access to someones account. This method depends on one key idea, that humans tend to use words for passwords or in this case for the key because words are easier to remember, however because of these dictionary attacks, this can leave your account or encryption vulnerable. The basis of these dictionary attacks is to simply attempt a very large set of words as the key to try and decrypt a message. This is very simple, as to do this we can download a text file filled with english words (The text file I will be using can be found here http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). Now all we have to do is attempt every word on this file, which on the file we will be using is 65,000 words. Though this may seem like many words you must keep in mind that even if we knew that the key was of length 4, using a brute-force attack we would still need to attempt $26^{4} = 4569764$ keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as I mentioned, there is one more problem we must over come, we can not manually check all 65,000 decrypted messages ourself as this will take a long time. To get around this we come up with a more robust method for checking if a message is likely the original than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a function which splits up each word (collectios of characters with a space inbetween them) in the decrypted message for a given key, and puts each individual word into a potential word list. Then for each element in the list, we want to check if this element is the same as any word in our dictionary text file which indicates that this element is a word. Thus we count how many words this message contains and then divide this by how many elements are in the potential word list, to get the percentage of words in this decrypted message are in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need a function that checks if the percentage of real words (words in the dictionary) and percentage of letters to characters in a message is above a certain threshold. If the message is above our threshold percentage, than we say there is a chance this is the original message. Hence by combining these two functions we have a more robust procedure to make sure only decrypted messages which are very likely to be the original are shown, which in effect means we only have to read a handful of wrong messages."
