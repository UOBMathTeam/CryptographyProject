    "Firstly before getting into different types of ciphers and how to crack these ciphers, we will define a cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cipher is simply an algorithm used to encrypt data, and since we use an algorithm, we can reverse this algorithm to decrypt already encrypted data given that we have enough information.\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms used for encryption can be very simple, in fact the first cipher we look at, The Caesar Cipher, was used by the Roman leader Julian Caeser to encrypt messages. The Caesar Cipher is a type of cipher known as a substitution cipher, this means that each letter (this can include symbols, numbers and pretty much any character you want) is replaced by another letter. The Caesar does this by first choosing a key which can be a numebr from 1 to 26 (this can be a larger range as you add more characters as you'll see) let's say we choose the key 12. Now you align the number 12, which has the letter L associated with it, with the letter A and shift everything else along with it as shown below.\n",

    "### Cracking The Caesar Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Although The Caesar Cipher would of been useful before the age of computers, today it is very rare in usage other than for introductions to Ciphers. The reason for this is because it is simply too easy for a computer to \"Brute-force attack\" the cipher. A Bruter-force attack is simple, it is an algorithm which attempts every possible key for a message and outputs the decryption of that message. In more advandced ciphers this is not a feasible method for cracking an encrypted message. However since the Caesar Cipher has a very small amount of possible keys, in our case only 95, it takes very little time to attempt every key. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now reading through every decrypted message to check if it is the original may still take a while, so we can check some properties the original message might display. For example if we know the most commonly used letter in the english language and the most commonly used word, we could quickly check if the decrypted message contains this word or has the same most common letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency, which we will use again later, we see that \"e\" is the most common letter, making up about 12.702% of all used letters. Also using data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English, we see that \"the\" is the most common word in the english language. From this we can check if the most common letter in our decrypted message is \"e\", or if the word \"the\" is contained within our decrypted message. If it is then we could highlight this message, which will allow us to see messages which our more likely to be the true message, and save us time. This is a technique we will go more in depth with later, this is just basic implementation of this data.\n"

    "### The Vigenère Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will look at another substitution cipher called the Vigenère Cipher. In fact the Vigenère Cipher is a polyalphabetic cipher, which means it uses multiple keys to encrypt the data at different points of the data. The Vigenère Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is just the Caesar Cipher applied to data multiple times with different keys at each point cycling through the same subkeys given by the key of the Vigenère Cipher. To clear this up it is easy to first follow an example. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a message we wish to encrypt using the Vigenère Cipher, we will use the message \"ENCRYPT THIS MESSAGE\". Now we need a key which we will use to encrypt this message, however unlike the Caesar Cipher, the Vigenère Cipher uses a collection of letters (or later we will see any character) to encrypt the message. For our example we will use the key \"SECRET\". Now each letter of our key \"SECRET\" is a subkey and we will cycle through these keys and apply the Caeser Cipher at each point in our message using the current subkey. Hence the first letter in our message is \"E\", and the first letter in our key is \"S\", so the letter \"E\" will be encrypted using the Caeser Cipher and the key \"S\". However of course S is not a number as our keys were when we previously used the Caesar Cipher, however again if you look at the table we used when discussing the Caesar Cipher, you can see the letter S has the number 19 associated with it, so this is the key we use. Thus the subkey used at each letter of the message is show below.     \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "    Vigenère key  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  | S  |    | E  | C  | R  | E  |    | T  | S  | E  | C  | R  | E  | T  |\n",
    "    Caesar subkey | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 | 19 |    | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  |    | 20 | 19 | 5  | 3  | 18 | 5  | 20 |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|       \n",
    "    Message       | E  | N  | C  | R  | Y  | P  | T  |    | T  | H  | I  | S  |    | M  | E  | S  | S  | A  | G  | E  |\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "However again as happened with the Caesar Cipher we can see that spaces must be ignored for now and all other characters but capital letters, again two versions of the Vigenère Cipher will be given, one basic and one which can as many characters as you want (In ASCII). \n",
    "\n",
    "Now Although the Vigenère Cipher is similar to the Caeser Cipher, it is orders of magnitude more secure. For example with the character set above \"Alphabet\", the Caesar Cipher has only 26 keys to attempt, however the Vigenère Cipher has $26^{n}$ possible keys where $n$ is the length of the key. Thus the longer the key you use the more secure your encrypted message is, this is why we can not use the \"Brute-force Attack\" against a message encrypted with Vigenère Cipher (Technically we can however this will become very unfeisable as the length of the key increases)."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher Using The Dictionary\n",
    "Here we will begin looking at how to crack the Vigenère Cipher, as mentioned before this is more difficult to do than on a message encrypted using the Caeser Cipher as we can not simple brute-force attack the message. The problem is that if the person encrypting the message is using only the alphabet as their character set to encrypt their message, we do not know how long the key is they are using. If we were to assume the key was of length somewhere in the range [1,12] we have many keys to test, in fact we have.\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\sum_{i=1}^{12} 26^{i} = 99246114928149461$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Which is a lot more than the 26 we had for the Caesar Cipher. On top of this taking the computer a very long time, we still have no rubust criteria that we can check a decrypted message against to see if it could be the original message, and it would take an extremly long time to check all 99246114928149462 decrypted messages. To add to the seemingly impossible task of cracking this cipher, we do not know how long the key actually is, so for all we know the key may be of length 10, 100, 1000 or anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus when trying to crack the Vigenère Cipher, we must go about this using a more efficent and robust method. One method we will use is called a \"Dictionary attack\", many hackers will use this method to attempt many passwords to gain access to someones account. This method depends on one key idea, that humans tend to use words for passwords or in this case for the key because words are easier to remember, however because of these dictionary attacks, this can leave your account or encryption vulnerable. The basis of these dictionary attacks is to simply attempt a very large set of words as the key to try and decrypt a message. This is very simple, as to do this we can download a text file filled with english words (The text file I will be using can be found here http://www.gwicks.net/dictionaries.htm). Now all we have to do is attempt every word on this file, which on the file we will be using is 65,000 words. Though this may seem like many words you must keep in mind that even if we knew that the key was of length 4, using a brute-force attack we would still need to attempt,\n",
    "\n",
    ">$26^{4} = 4569764$ keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "However as I mentioned, there is one more problem we must over come, we can not manually check all 65,000 decrypted messages ourself as this will take a long time. To get around this we come up with a more robust method for checking if a message is likely the original than before. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we need a function which splits up each word (collectios of characters with a space inbetween them) in the decrypted message for a given key, and puts each individual word into a potential word list. Then for each element in the list, we want to check if this element is the same as any word in our dictionary text file which indicates that this element is a word. Thus we count how many words this message contains and then divide this by how many elements are in the potential word list, to get the percentage of words in this decrypted message are in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we need a function that checks if the percentage of real words (words in the dictionary) and percentage of letters to characters in a message is above a certain threshold. If the message is above our threshold percentage, than we say there is a chance this is the original message. Hence by combining these two functions we have a more robust procedure to make sure only decrypted messages which are very likely to be the original are shown, which in effect means we only have to read a handful of wrong messages."

    "### Cracking The Vigenère Cipher (Key Lengths)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now clearly the method used above is not very efficent and has many limitations as checking 65,000 keys can still take a long time for the average computer, especially when the key used for encyption may not even be a word so will not be able to be decrypted using this method. Another problem is that if the word starts with a z for example \"zurrich\", the algorithm will try every word that comes before it alphabetically, rather than trying the most likely keys first. We now try to get past these limitations and crack the Vigenère Cipher for almost all cases as we will see, in doing this we will no longer use the basic Vigenère Cipher, instead we will use the extended version that uses any character set. The method we will be using is called \"The Babbage Attack & Kasiski Examination\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in this method is to identify any repeated sequences in the enrypted message. We only count sequences of letters of 3 or more, however in this code we will limit ourselves to sequences of any length from 3 to 6 to speed up the algorithm. The reason we do this is because many words such as \"the\", as I mentioned before, are used many times in a single message, or we can notice that most verbs have the same ending \"ing\". Now if we notice that the same sequence of letters repeat multiple times, this may indicate the same letters being encrypted using the same subkey as before due to the subkey repeating. For example, if we encrypt the sentance \"You going running?\", using our Vigenère Cipher with the key \"examples\", the output is \"?hWmX\\\\ObMxTc_[ObM8\". We notice that the sequence of letters \"obM\" repeats twice. This can be explained by following the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vigenère key  | e  | x  | a  |  m | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  | a  | m  | p  | l  | e  | s  | e  | x  |\n",
    "                  |----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|     \n",
    "    Message       | Y  | o  | u  |    | g  | o  | i  | n  | g  |    | r  | u  | n  | n  | i  | n  | g  | ?  | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how in our message we have the repeated sequence \"ing\" eppear twice, and both times this is being encrypted using the \n",
    "same subkeys, \"e\", \"s\" and \"e\" respectively. This is extremely useful when trying to find the key, as we can now count the number of characters between repeats of sequences. As you can see the number of characters between the repeated sequence \"obM\" in our encrypted message is 8, counting from the first letter of the first sequence, to the letter before the beggining of the second sequence. Here it just so happens that the number of characters between the repeats is the exact same as the legnth of the key, however this will not happen all the time. Though this is not always true it is true that if the same letters in the orginial message are being encoded by the same characters in the key, than one of the factors of the distance between these two sequences must be the true key length, due to the cyclic nature of the encryption. This brings us to the next step of our method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we must find the factors of the distance between repeated sequences. To show how we do this we will look at a longer encrypted message given below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">\"'kGmj\\[sMhK\\XlXiTgK\\XlRUZ^Tme\\JU_8a7wcKsH^G\\p_KUJbPUpNHc[madfefsjTaOpYUhekGQV[Z`_&a7wZehXrK\\XlSme[GaelZcelVOcaef[gPW_Ts\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can check for youself using the functions below, this encrypted message has four repeated sequences \"K\\\\X\", \"\\\\XL\", \"A7W\" and \"K\\\\XL\". Now the distances between these repeated sequences are 8, 48, 72 and 80. In this part of the method as I mentioned we get the factors of the distances between the sequences, however we only want the factors that occur most, as these are more likely to be the true key length. In this case the most likely key lengths would be 2, 4 and 8 as they are factors of all 4 distances. Our next step will be to get every second, fourth and eigth letter, however before doing this we will create functions to carry out our method thus far.\n",

We will have to do this for all key lengths we think could potentially be correct, which we set to be limited to the 5 most likely above. This is very simple for us to do, we just look at our message and choose every $N^{th}$ character starting from the first character of the message. We then do this again starting from the second character of the message, and repeat this up to the $N-1$ character in the message. Again we repeat this for each potential key length.

Our next step will be deciding which characters are most likely to be our subkey.\n",

We do this by checking if the 6 most frequent letters in our decrypted message and the 6 least frequent letters match the data .

However I feel it is noteworth to mention the fact that if the encrypter uses a key the same length of the message, the message is uncrackable without attempting every possible key length and combination.

    "### The Affine Cipher\n",

    "Now we will look at our third and final cipher, the Affine Cipher. Again the Affine Cipher is another monoalphabetic substitution cipher, in fact the Affine Cipher incorporates two ciphers in one. The first cipher it uses we have already met, it is the Caesar Cipher however the other cipher we have yet to discuss, it is called the Multiplicative Cipher. Before we discuss the Affine Cipher, we must understand the Multiplicative Cipher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Multiplicative Cipher is very similar to the Caesar Cipher, in fact it is the same sort of substituion cipher as the Caesar Cipher. The only difference between the two is that in the Caesar Cipher we find the index of each character in a message and add the value of our key to the characters index to get a new index which we use to substitute our original character out for a new one, however in the Multplicative Cipher, rather than simply adding the key to the index we multiply it. Again like in the Caesar Cipher, this multiplying of the index must be done modulo the length of our character set as if we did not do this our new index may be out of the character sets range. Below we will look at the same example we used for the Caesar Cipher, and see how a key of 12 will affect the indexes if we were to use the alphabet as our character set for the Multiplicative Cipher:\n",

    "To be clear the top row is the character set with each characters index being shown, and below is the character that gets mapped to the character above when encrypted. Now after applying the key 12, as you can see the multiplicative cipher changes the indexes, however they are not all unique, in fact because of modular arithmatic after the originial letter indexed 12 the each letter is indexed the same way as the first 12. This as you may guess, is a big issue as when trying to decrypt a message using the above key how do we know whever the letter \"A\" should when decrypted become \"A\" again or \"N\". It is impossible to know this, so to avoid this we must use a key that is coprime to the length of our character set this way no overlapping letters will occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how the Multiplicative Cipher works, the Affine Cipher is easy to understand. When using the Affine Cipher we need two keys, one key which we use for the encrypting the message using the Multiplicative Cipher that we will call \"Multkey\" and another for the Caesar Cipher that we will call \"Caesarkey\". If we want to encrypt using the Affine Cipher we first apply the Multiplicative Cipher to the message (essentially we multiply the index of each character by the Multkey) and then we apply the Caesar Cipher to the new message (Just add Caesar key to the index of each character), again we do this all modulo the length of the character set. If instead we want to decrypt using the Affine Cipher, instead we subtract the Ceasarkey from the index of each character in the message, and then multiply each index by the modular inverse of the Multikey and do this all modulo the length of the character set too. We have spoken about modular inverses earlier, so we know that if we multiply our Multikey by it's modular inverse \"m\" we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $Multikey \\times m \\equiv 1 mod(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $n$ is the length of our character set. Thus to see why this decryption process works lets say our Multikey is $M$ and it's modular inverse is $m$, let $n$ be the length of our character set, $a$ our Caesar key and finally $i$ the index of a character in the message we wish to encrypt. When encrypting $i$ we will get a new index we will call $e$ and we calculate this as so:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $e = (iM + a) mod(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to see how we get the original index when decrypting see below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $i = (m \\times (e - a))mod(n) = (m \\times (iM))mod(n) = imod(n) = i$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Cracking The Affine Cipher\n",
    "\n",
    "The method for cracking the Affine Cipher is the same as the method we used for the Caesar Cipher, we use a \"Brute-force Attack\". The reason for this is because, there are a limited amount of keys you can use for the Affine Cipher, in fact if $n$ is the length of our character set, there are only $n^{2}$ possible keys. The reason being for this is simple, it is because we work modulo $n$ and we have a choice for the Multikey of which there are $n$ possible values it can take due to working modulo $n$ (actually a bit less since we wouldn't expect this to be a value of 1 or a value such that gcd(Multikey,$n$) is not equal to 1), and for the Caesarkey we also have $n$ possible keys. Thus the amount of combinations of keys we can have is equal to at most:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$n \\times n = n^{2}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is the reason for having the section of code in our Affine Cipher that let us input one key and in return we got both the Caesarkey and Multikey. The code is set up to cycle through all possible combinations of keys. To show how this works, again let $M$ be our Multikey $a$ our Caesar key and $A$ our Affine Key then in our code we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $M = \\lfloor\\frac{A}{n}\\rfloor$\n",
    "\n",
    "> $a = Amod(n)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now for $x \\in \\{1,2,...,n\\}$ if:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ (x)n = A $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have that for $y \\in \\{0,1,...,n-1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "> $ a = (A + y) mod(n) = y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we cycle through all $n$ combinations for $a$, and here we also have:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $M = \\lfloor\\frac{A+y}{n}\\rfloor = x$\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence by cycling through all choices for $x$ and $y$ we test all combinations of possible keys. Thus we will now implement this into a function to Brute force all combinations of keys below and crack the Affine Cipher."

    "### Sophie Germain Prime\n",
    "\n",
    "First, before discussing the Diffie-Hellman protcol, we will be discussing what a Sophie Germain prime is and why it is useful in many situations for cryptography. Simply a Sophie Germain prime is a prime $q$ such that $p = 2q+1$ is also a prime which is called the complimentary safe prime of the $q$. The complimentary safe prime is very useful due to one of the properties it exhibits, to see this property we look at the prime decomposition of $p-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> $p - 1 = (2q + 1) - 1 = 2q$\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this we already have the prime decompostion of $p-1$, it is simply $2q$. Now if you're wondering why this is useful, we must first discuss primitive roots. \n",
    "\n",
    "A primitive root of a prime $p$ is a value we will call $a$, where $a$ is an integer such that the smallest value $l$, known as the multiplicative order of $a$ relative to $p$, for which,\n",
    "\n",
    "> $a^{l} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "is true is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $l = p-1$\n",
    "\n",
    "It was proven by the German mathmatician Gauss, that all primes have a primitive root and that the amount of primitive roots a prime has is equal to  $\\phi{(p-1)}$, where  $\\phi$ is Eulers totient, so we do not have to worry about a lack of primitive roots. Now a useful fact we can use is that the multiplicative order of $a mod(p)$ will always be a divisior of $p-1$. Thus we have found the use for a Sophie Germain prime, since we know the prime factorization of $p-1$ where $p$ is the complementary safe prime to some Sophie Germain prime $p$, we can use this to easily test if a value $a$ is a primitive root of the complementary safe prime. To do this all we have to do is check if for the safe prime p, any of the following are true:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{1} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{2} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$a^{\\frac{(p-1)}{2}} \\equiv 1mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We only have to check this since we know the multiplicative order of $a mod(p)$ is a divisor of $2q$, so the multiplicative order must be $1,2$ or $q$, hence if none of the above are true, then the multiplicative order is $2q$ which means $a$ is a primitive root of our safe prime. This will get us started on the Diffie-Hellman protocol, so first we write a function to get Sophie Germain primes, and their complementary safe primes along with a function to get primitive roots for complementary safe primes."

    "### The Deffie-Hellman Protocol - First Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing the first steps of the Diffie-Hellman protocol, we will discuss what the protocol does. This protocol allows two or more parties (In cryptography the first two parties are usually referred to as Alice and Bob) to generate a shared secret key that each party knows, and has access to, without ever having to communicate the key in any form. The importance here is that the secret key is not communicated between parties, because if it is, the key is then suseptible to being observed by an outside party. Thus from this it is easy to see why the Deffie-Hellman protocol is so useful. An example of one of the main uses of this is that it allows parties say Alice and Bob to send encrypted messages to each other using the secret key and then decrypt these message using the same secret key. Hence if an outside party was to observe one of these messages, without the secret key they will not be able to read the message (at least without knowing how they encrypted the message and any potential cracks for this method).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does the Diffie-Hellman protocol work? First we will look at the two party situation, and we will call these parties Alice and Bob. To begin we need both Alice and Bob to have access to a very large safe prime $p$ (when discussing this protcol we will be using a 256 bit prime) and a primtive root of the prime we will call $g$, however unlike the secret key, $p$ and $g$ can be made public for anyone to have access to. Now when dicussing how the protocol works, you may soon notice that the safe prime Bob and Alice make public does not need to be a safe prime or even a prime at all and the primitive root can be any number for the protocol to work. Despite this we use a safe prime and a primitive root because hackers can calculate discrete logarithms (for example by using the Pohlig-Hellman protocol) to work out the secret key, however the algorithms hackers use is much faster if the number we make public here is not a safe prime, thus for security purposes we use a safe prime and one of the primitive roots for this prime. Hence by using our \"sgrandprime\" function above, we can generate a safe prime for Alice and Bob to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the next step we want Alice and Bob to generate a private key for themselves, they can not tell each other about these keys nor anyone else, this is for them and only them to know and have access to. This private key is a random number, for alice we will call her private key $a$ and for Bob $b$, however the larger the private key again the better as it makes it harder for hackers to get access to the secret key so again we generate 256 bit random numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will generate the safe prime $p$ and primitive root $g$ using the functions from before, also we will make a function to generate our the private keys $a$ and $b$."

    "### The Diffie-Hellman protocol - Generating Secret Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Alice and Bob have their private keys, their next step is to generate their public keys. We will call the public key Alice generates $A$ and Bobs $B$. To generate these public keys we do the following calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$A = g^{a}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    ">$B = g^{b}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "After we complete these calculations, we now have the public keys for Alice and Bob. The next step is for Alice to send her public key $A$ to Bob, and for Bob to send $B$ to Alice. Though this seems like a compromising step for a protocol based around security, for a hacker to use the public keys to get the private keys it is very difficult because $p$ is a safe prime and $g$ is a primitive root for $p$. By using these numbers a hacker has a very small amount of attack vectors when trying to find the private keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Alice has Bobs public key and Bob has Alices, we calculate the secret key that we will now call $S$. When calculating the secret key this must be done seperately by both Bob and Alice in private as to not let anyone gain access to the secret key. For Alice to generate the $S$ she must do the following calculation:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = B^{a}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and Bob must generate $S$ by calculating:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = A^{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This at first look may not be entirely obvious as to why the calculation Alice does calculates the same secret key as Bobs calculations. However this is due to simple properties of modulo exponents, as you can see below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$S = B^{a} = (g^{b}mod(p))^{a} = g^{ba}mod(p) = (g^{a}mod(p))^{b} = A^{b} = S$\n",
    "\n",
    "However the calculations above only apply to a two party system. Luckily for us this generalizes quite simply for an $n$ party system. As before we have our safe prime $p$ and a primitive root of $p$ we call $g$, and all $n$ parties must generate their own private key in the same way as before and their relative public key in the same way as before. The only difference for an $n$ party system comes when calculating the secret key $S$. To do this let us label the n private keys generated as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $P_{1}, P_{2}, ... , P_{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now all n parties have already calculated their relative public keys, which are as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $g^{P_{1}}mod(p), g^{P_{2}}mod(p), ... , g^{P_{n}}mod(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our final secret key $S$ to be of the same form before, meaning we have $g^{x}mod(p)$, where $x$ is the product of all private keys involved. Hence to achieve this in an n party case, we first label each party $1,2,..n$ and the $i^{th}$ party must send their public key to the $(i+1)^{th}$ party also party $n$ must give his public key to party $1$. Then each member must generate their new public key as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $(g^{P_{n}}mod(p))^{P_{1}}, g^{P_{1}}mod(p))^{P_{2}}, ... , g^{P_{n-1}}mod(p))^{P_{n}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this has been completed, we again get each party to send their new public key to the party ahead of them. We repeat this process a total of $n-1$ times, and the final calculation will give each party the secret key $S$ which for the $i{th}$ party will be of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $(g^{P_{i-1}P_{i-2}...P_{1}P_{n}...P_{i+1}}mod(p))^{P_{i}} = g^{P_{1}P_{2}...P_{n}}mod(p) = S$\n",
    "\n",
    "After all parties have the secret key $S$, they can send each other messages encrypted using the key $S$ and decrypt the messages they receive from one another. Below are the functions we use to achieve this."
