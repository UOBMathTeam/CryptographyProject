This finds the smallest factor of $899$ by finding the remainder when dividing $899$ with each increasing integer starting from $2$. Once the remainder of this division is equal to $0$, we return the value which we divided $899$ by and in this case, it would be $29$.\n",

    "### Decompose Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "A good guess for the time complexity of the decompose function we are using is $O(2^p)$, where $p$ is the bit size of one of our non-trivial prime factors of $N = pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are of the same bit size. We are able to estimate the time complexity because we have found the average runtime and average number of operations the decompose function performs and they increase by the same rate as we will explain later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the average runtime, from earlier, the mean ratio (from a sample size of 4 for each bit size) of the average run time for the decompose function performs for consecutive $N's$ is the roughly the same at $2$. Furthermore, the standard deviation for the ratio is small implying that the ratio roughly stays constant. In addition, the graphs for the average decompose run time is in the shape of $y = 2^x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for consecutive $N's$, the average number of operations for the decompose function roughly doubles too and the ratio has a low standard deviation too, as seen above, meaning this ratio stays constant. Since, the average number of operations also increases at the same rate as the average run time of the decompose function, we have a good amount of evidence to be confident that this function does have an $O(2^p)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this may not necessarily be the case because our graph for the average runtimes may change drastically for larger $p$ and $q$ but it is a reasonable guess because the data points we have fit this model well. From this time complexity, we are able to extrapolate the graph and make estimates for the average decompose times for larger $N$."

    "### Estimating the Average Decompose Time for Larger $N$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is of our best interest to be able to estimate the average decompose time because as the bit size increases for $N$, it takes longer to find the average time taken, and to find when it become infeasible, we want to find how long it takes for larger $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to estimate the average decompose time for larger values of $N$, we will plot a graph of shape $y = c \\cdot 2^x$, where $c$ is our average decompose runtime for our smallest value of $N$, this would be when $p$ and $q$ are of $10$ bit sizes. We will compute a better average time for this value of $N$ using a larger sample size of $20$, because this value is our scale factor for the graph so will affect all values in our graph a lot so it must be as accurate as possible.

    "## At What Bit Length does the Decompose Function Become Infeasible?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Purpose of the Decompose Function (Security)\n",
    "The purpose of the decompose function is to find the prime decomposition of a number. In terms of an RSA setting, we would be using this function to attempt to crack the private key, which are, say, primes $p$ and $q$ given the public key $N = pq$. From the public key, we are also given $e$, an auxiliary number called the exponent but the decompose function does not use this information. Therefore, it is clear to see that the decompose function, which does not use the exponent will not be as efficient at finding the prime decomposition as a function which does use this extra information, like the RSA decryption method mentioned in the previous question.\n",
    "Furthermore, since the private key in an RSA setting is usually 2048 bits long, the decompose function is not effective at all at cracking this. This is because, as we discussed earlier in the time complexity section, due to the decompose function being $O(2^p)$, it is effective at cracking short private keys but becomes ineffective very quickly as the bit length of the private key increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum Bit Length Feasibility\n",
    "The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) recommends that you should update private and public keys at least once every $2$ years, and since the decompose function's purpose is to crack the private key, I can conjecture that it becomes infeasible if it takes longer than $2$ years to crack it. \n",

However, with quantum computers currently being developed which are a lot faster than traditional computers, RSA and many other traditional encryption methods used today may become obsolete; a huge security issue. Luckily, there are already a few quantum-resistant security protocols which are being developed to work around this encryption problem so hopefully these encryption methods will be developed before quantum computers because otherwise it would result in a security disaster.\n",

    "### What is The Pollard Rho Method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pollard Rho method is an algorithm used for factorising large composite integers, $N$. It has been heuristically claimed, but not rigorously, that the Pollard Rho method works in runs at a time of $O(N^{0.25})$. It is very effective at finding small factors of a composite integer. Since we are primarily concerned with factorising $N$ = $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, since this is what we do in an RSA setting, we will be looking at this case and compare how efficient the Pollard Rho method is in comparison to the decompose function. \n",
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollard%27s_rho_algorithm#Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Does it Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main steps in the Pollard Rho method. These are described below. This method has been taken from the Handbook of Applied Cryptography Chapter $3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to generate a random sequence of integers which are less than the composite integer we are factorising, $N$. This is done using using the function \n",
    "> $g(m) = (m^2 + 1) \\pmod N$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A starting value $m_0 = 2$, is chosen and each pair of integers in the sequence is generated using  \n",
    ">$(m_{i+1}, m_{2(i + 1)}) = (g(m_i), g(g(m_{2i})))$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are choosing to compute pairs of integers to increase space efficiency; this works due to Floyd's Cycle Finding algorithm which we will discuss in more detail later. We compute the sequence until we get to $(m_k, m_{2k})$ where $k \\approx 10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$. We have chosen this value of $k$ because it has been stated in the question that if we iterate our next step this number of times then we find with high probability, a non-trivial prime factor of $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Step\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step is to find the greatest common divisor ($gcd$) of the difference between the pairs we have generated in the sequence and the number we're attempting to factorise, $N$. We have three different cases here. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = 1$ for $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$ where $k \\approx 10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above statement holds, we test it for the next $i$ in our set and we keep iterating this until we get a different value for our $gcd$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If next case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$ for some $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$ and some $1 < p < N$ $\\iff m_{2i} \\equiv m_i \\pmod p$ $\\iff p \\mid m_{2i} - m_i$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we have found a non-trivial prime factor of N in this case and this non-trivial prime factor is indeed the value of $p$. This outcome occurs with very high probability. This is because we expect all $(m_i, m_{2i})$ such that $1 \\leq i < k$ to be distinct modulo $N$ so we expect to find at least one pair $(m_i, m_{2i})$ where $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$ and $1 < p < N$. Since we are concerned with the case where $N = pq$, we simply find our other prime factor by dividing $N$ by $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final case is where,\n",
    ">$gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = N$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This statement is equivalent to $\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid = 0$ meaning that there is a pair in the sequence that are equal to eachother (this happens with low probability). Therefore, by Floyd's cycle finding algorithm, $m_i$ becomes cyclic at the first time $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = N$; after this point, no matter how many times we iterate the Pollard Rho method, we will not find any more factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the Pollard Rho method keeps iterating $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N)$ until we reach one of these three criteria. Either until we find that $1 < gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) < N$, in which we return a non-trivial factor of $N$. Or until we compute $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N)$ for all $i \\in \\{1,2,3, ... k\\}$, and if this doesn't return a value between $0$ and $N$ each time, we return a failure. Or, finally, if $gcd(\\mid m_{2k} - m_k \\mid, N) = N$ in which case we also return a failure. In the event that we return a failure, one possible solution is to try altering our function $g(m) = (m^2 + 1)$ $mod$ $N$ to $g(m) = (m^2 + c)$ $mod$ $N$ where $c$ is any integer such that $c \\neq 0, -2, 1$. This produces a different sequence of values and in this new sequence, we find $m_i \\equiv m_{2i} \\pmod p$ for some $1 \\leq i \\leq k$, and hence a non-trivial prime factor of N with high probability."

    "### Birthday Paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pollard Rho method takes advantage of the birthday paradox in order to find pairs in a large sequence of numbers which satisfy this criteria: $gcd(\\mid m_{2i} - m_i \\mid, N) = p$.\n",
    "So understanding this paradox is the key to learning how the Pollard Rho method works,so we will briefly explain this concept here. \n",
    "\n",
    "This paradox is concerned with the probability in a set of $n$ randomly chosen people, some pair of them will share the same birthday. It is a paradox because it turns out this probability is a lot higher than you would expect. For example, in a room of $23$ people, there is a $50$% chance that at least two people share the same birthday and in a room of $75$ people, there is a $99.9$% chance of at least two people sharing the same birthday. \n",
    "By some combinations mathematics, in a room of $23$ people, there are $253$ pairs; this is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\frac{23 \\cdot 22}{2} = 253$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the chance of two people having different birthdays is clearly:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$1 - \\frac{1}{365} = \\frac{364}{365}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the chance of all $23$ people in the room having different birthdays is:\n",
    "\n",
    ">$\\frac{364}{365}^{253} = 0.4995$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the chance of two people having the same birthday is about $50/50$ and it is easy to see that this probability exponentially increases as the number of people in the room increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-the-birthday-paradox/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "By the birthday paradox, it follows that we find a non-trivial prime factor of N with probability $1/2$ in $O(\\sqrt p) \\leq O(N^{0.25})$ time, assuming that the sequence we generate is truly random. However, we only have a heuristic claim that the Pollard Rho method has the same time complexity and a rigorous analysis of this method still remains open. A time complexity is an asymptotic upper bound, because it bounds the growth of the running time for large enough input sizes. However, it is important to note that this is not necessarily an asymptotically tight bound. For example, in our case, the running time for the Pollard Rho method grows no faster than $c \\cdot N^{0.25}$ for some constant $c$; it could in fact grow a lot slower than at a rate of $N^{0.25}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the function $g:S \\rightarrow S$ as we stated earlier and since $S$ is a finite set of cardinality $N$, this function will eventually cycle. By some number theory of random numbers, we have that the expected length of the tail of the sequence of integers $m_i$ is $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 8}$ and the expected length of the endlessly repeating cycle is also $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 8}$. The method in which one would initially think to find duplicates in the sequence is by storing all the integers in the sequence, and checking for duplicates in a pairwise fashion (i.e. checking all possible pairs of the sequence). By the birthday problem, the expected number of inputs until a pair of integers $m_i$ and $m_j$ are equal to eachother is $\\sqrt{\\pi N / 2}$. Therefore, this method of finding when the sequence becomes cyclic takes up $O(\\sqrt N)$ memory and $O(\\sqrt N)$ time. For example, if we had the sequence of integers $x_1, x_2, ..., x_k$ where $k = N^{0.25}$ where $N \\sim 10^{30}$ and did pairwise comparisons we would have to store $10^8$ numbers in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/courses/csci2824-spr14/pollardsRho.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to reduce the storage requirements of the Pollard Rho method drastically to only two numbers using Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm so in our code, we will employ this version of the Pollard Rho method. We will discuss how the Floyd's cycle finding algorithm works in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm allows us to easily find when the sequence cycles using only pairs of numbers from the sequence and we only need to store one pair at a time. Therefore, when using this algorithm, the Pollard Rho method has a space complexity of only $O(1)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "I will proceed to explain this by analogy. Suppose we have two runners, A and B with B running twice as fast as A, where they start at the same position. Then, when B has overtaken A we know that B has cycled around at least once so we can stop the algorithm at this point. In the analogy, runner A is $a = g(a)$ from our pollard_rho function below and runner B is $b = g(g(b))$ from the same pollard_rho function. We know that $b$ has 'overtaken' $a$ when $\\mid a-  b \\mid = 0$ or equivalently, when $gcd(\\mid a - b \\mid,N) = N$. Therefore, at this point the sequence becomes cyclic and we can return a failure and try finding a non-trivial prime factor of $N$ by using a different function $g$.\n",

    "### Our Pollard Rho Function\n",

    "From our graphs which plot the average run time of these two factoring algorithms for $N$ = $pq$ where $p$ and $q$ are prime numbers, we can see that the average decompose run time is consistently lower for smaller bit sizes of $N$. However, when $N$ reaches $35$ bits, the average run time for the Pollard Rho function is lower than the average decompose run time for the first time.  From this bit size, the difference between the run time for the Pollard Rho function and the decompose function increases, depicting how the Pollard Rho method is far more effective than the decompose function with large bit sizes of $N$."

    "As we can see above, the operations actually performed by the function is close to this worst-case scenario often so it turns out the graphs look pretty much identical. Therefore, since the worst-case scenario is where we iterate the function $10 \\cdot N^{0.25}$ times, the graph has this shape, which would suggest that the time complexity is indeed $O(N^{0.25})$. Now, we will check if the average run time for the Pollard Rho also has this shape, and then we have strong evidence to support the time complexity being $O(N^{0.25})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why the worst-case scenario and actual scenario are so similar is because I have coded the $N's$ to be generated such that the two non-trivial prime factors $p$ and $q$ are of the same bit length, meaning that the factors are quite large, especially for a larger bit size of $N$. This makes it more of a worst case scenario because as I stated at the start of this section, Pollard Rho is most effective when factorising small factors."

Also, judging by the way the approximate running time of Lenstra's algorithm stays roughly the same ffrom bit sizes $10$ to $35$, it is not an unreasonable assumption that Lenstra's will be able to factorise far larger $N$ than Pollard's Rho, Pollard's $p-1$ and the decompose function could. We will test this claim in more detail later through more %timeit tests for larger bit sizes of $N$.\n",
