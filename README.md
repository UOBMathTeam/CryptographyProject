## Recommended Viewing
This is a very large project, so to view it on lower end computers it is recommended to view the corresponding html document of the project

## Running The Entire ipynb file
Make sure read_times = True
This will make the project read times instead of generating them from data which was pregenerated.
In Core 1 the code sometimes asks for the users input just enter "Yes" and the notebook will finnish executing that cell.
It is worth noting sometimes the tests or a function will fail as the way primes are generated are by probabilistic methods which have a chance of failing.

## What was the code run on?
The timeit python functions and other timming code were benchmarked on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600k CPU @ 3.50GHz
To keep these times coherent through the project the timeit cells have been frozen and read_times = True by default.
