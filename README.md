## Recommended Viewing
This is a very large project, so to view it on lower end computers it is recommended to view the corresponding html document of the project.
This project will take at least 40 seconds to load the .ipynb file but this depends on the computer being used to view the file. Additionally, because of the long load times by default Nbextensions don't work as the loading of them will time out.
Additionally, when viewing the html document make sure you are sufficiently zoomed out or some of the rendered text will not display properly, for example if the title doesn't have the width space required one line will go over multiple lines making the title display incorrectly.

## Running The Entire ipynb file
Make sure read_times = True
This will make the project read times instead of generating them from data which was pregenerated.
In Core 1 the code sometimes asks for the users input just enter "Yes" and the notebook will finnish executing that cell.
It is worth noting sometimes the tests or a function will fail as the way primes are generated are by probabilistic methods which have a chance of failing.

## What was the code run on?
The timeit python functions and other timming code were benchmarked on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6600k CPU @ 3.50GHz
To keep these times coherent through the project the timeit cells have been frozen/locked and read_times = True by default.
Each time the %timeit python function is called there is a comment below it with the benchmark times.
